# Verilog_Projects
 The well-defined verilog projects.

This is a series of verilog projects completed with respect to Intel's Quartus Prime Lite edition for FPGA programming and for actual FPGA prototyping we would be using XILINX ISE software. The FPGA used will be MIMAS V2 SPARTAN 6 FPGA.
This series will include:
1. Serial FIR Filter
2. Parallel FIR Filter
3. N-tap FIR filter (both serial and parallel)
4. Soda Despenser machine
5. FIFO implementation and 7-segment display using IP blocks.
6. FFT algorithm
7. PWM Generator
8. AES encryption and decryption Algorithm
9. I2C Communication Protocol
10. UART Communication protocol using IP
